## Installation Guide

### Setting Up a Conda Environment
You can establish a `conda` environment by employing the [environment.yml](environment.yml) file. This approach includes necessary packages like `jupyter` to facilitate running demo notebooks.

1. Ensure you have [Conda](https://conda.io) **installed** on your computer, for example, by using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda).
2. Then, **run** the following command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Running Example Notebooks
To explore ``ENF`` notebooks:

1. **Clone the repository:** Download the ``edu_novfct`` repository to your local machine using the following git command:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/groupmm/edu_novfct.git
```

2. **Install Jupyter:** If not already installed via the conda environment setup, install Jupyter to run the notebooks:

```
pip install jupyter
```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Start the Jupyter notebook server by executing: 
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open a browser window from where you can navigate to and open the example notebooks.
